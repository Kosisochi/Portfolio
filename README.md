# Work Experience
## **Senior Business Data Analyst**

**Bank of Montreal | Toronto, Ontario	( Aug 2024 – Present)**
- Led the data validation, reconciliation, and cleaning of thousands of third-party supplier records, consolidating multiple data sources into a single, centralized repository, resulting in a 95% reduction in data discrepancies and improved data accuracy.
- Conducted data quality checks to update supplier records, to handle duplicates and missing data which enhanced data completeness and reduced manual data entry time by 80%.
- Built a transformer-based abstractive text summarization model to provide short descriptions of over 3000 third-party supplier services from an average of 800 characters to less than 250 characters per description, reducing the time taken from over 3 months to 5 minutes. 
- Implemented an improved third-party supplier data collection system to prevent duplicates and errors, leading to a 50% increase in data reliability and an efficient data management system.
- 	Automated many multi-system repetitive processes for issue and risk management saving over 300 labor-intensive manual entry hours.

  
## **Senior AI & Data Consultant**

**Ernst & Young LLP | Wellington, New Zealand	(_Jun 2023 – Mar 2024_)**
-	Furthered solution design within the firm through the design of Generative AI–based proof of concept for improving internal EY processes and bidding on client work. This included prompt engineering and building AI apps with Python.
-	Designed and implemented key performance metrics for asset and work management operations, resulting in a 60% reduction in contractor scheduling conflicts and decreasing critical equipment stock-out from an average of 20 occurrences to 3 per quarter.
-	Established Power BI dashboards that increased self-service data analysis usage by 70%, enabling teams to make faster more informed decisions for supply chain, customer & billing, and asset management. 
-	Reduced rework in the product development process by 75% through agile development methodologies, rapidly wireframing/prototyping the specified requirements and fostering efficient collaboration with product owners.
-	Significantly minimized ambiguity during product handover by developing detailed design documents to effectively communicate with and guide the client/stakeholder through each stage.


## **AI & Data Consultant**

**Ernst & Young LLP | Wellington, New Zealand	(_Jun 2022 – Jun 2023_)**
- Developed and executed SQL scripts to extract and analyze data from large databases for the creation of insightful reports that informed stakeholder decision-making process.
- Reduced backlog by 85% in 3 months by providing timely BAU (Business as Usual) support for a managed service and implementing a batching process for addressing issue tickets, incidents, and tasks.
- Reduced onboarding effort of new team members by 60% through maintaining knowledge bases of known issues and fixes and created documentation and manuals to ensure information is recorded, updated, and shared.
- Cultivated robust relationships with key stakeholders by approaching discussions with an open mind, and adeptly gathered requirements through insightful conversations and questions. Produced and presented monthly reports to summarise the operational activities of the key technical stakeholders/owners. 
- Delivered coaching and mentorship, which contributed to the professional development and growth of consultants and interns and promoted morale in a constantly changing environment.



## **Artificial Intelligence Researcher** 

**Victoria University of Wellington | Wellington, New Zealand (_Apr 2019 - May 2022_)**
- Designed end-to-end NLP experiments to extract and construct informative features for a supervised text classification task (predictive modelling) to detect hate speech on social media platforms using algorithms such as LSTM, RNN, and CNN with tools like NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and Python.
- Designed unsupervised NLP/machine learning experiments based on K-means clustering to identify the target of hate speech text. This reduced dependence on scarce and biased labelled data and introduced model explainability using tools like NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras and Python.
- Analyzed result data using Excel and Python, and published the statistically validated research results in peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journal articles.
- Presented research ideas and findings at 5 international conferences and 2 competitions using Matplotlib and Seaborn for results visualization.



## **Academic Data Analyst**

**Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Nigeria, Nsukka | Enugu, Nigeria	(_May 2016 – Jan 2019_)**
- Analyzed experimental results from completed digital electronic engineering research for publications and conferences. 
- Cleaned and analyzed thousands of rows of student examination result data to calculate individual course results and cumulative GPA.
- Digitized old student records for the alumni office and established validated data collection processes for new records.
- Designed exam timetables for four levels of departmental courses, ensuring no conflicts with faculty or inter-level courses. This allowed students to retake exams from different levels without scheduling conflicts.
